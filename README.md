## Features

- Displays Pokémon information, including images, names, types, and abilities.
- Allows filtering Pokémon by type.
- Supports searching for Pokémon by name.
- Provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## How it Works

GeeksterMon is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an overview of how it works:

### HTML Structure

- The HTML structure defines the layout of the web page, including the header, forms, and the pokedex section.
- Forms are used for filtering by type and searching for Pokémon by name.

### CSS Styling

- CSS styles define the visual appearance of the application, including fonts, colors, and layout.
- Flip card animations are applied to create an interactive card-based display for Pokémon.

### JavaScript Functionality

- JavaScript is used to fetch data about Pokémon from the PokeAPI.
- It dynamically creates Pokémon cards with front and back sides for each Pokémon.
- Users can filter Pokémon by type and search for them by name.
- Event listeners are used to handle user interactions and update the displayed Pokémon accordingly.
